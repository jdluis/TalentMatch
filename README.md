# TalentMatch
<br>

## Description
The app is a developer search engine that helps companies find talented developers based on specific criteria such as skill set, experience level, and location. It offers a database of developers who have created profiles showcasing their skills and experience. Companies can browse these profiles and filter results to find the best candidates for their projects. The app also provides features such as messaging and interview scheduling to streamline the hiring process. With its focus on connecting companies with developers, the app offers a valuable resource for businesses looking to build their development teams without the need to post specific job listings.
